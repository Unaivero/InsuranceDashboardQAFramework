    client.authenticate("admin@insurance.com", "admin123");
    
    PolicyApiModel policy = ApiTestDataProvider.getInstance().generateSampleApiPolicy();
    ApiResponse<PolicyApiModel> response = client.createPolicy(policy);
    
    assertTrue(response.isSuccess());
    assertNotNull(response.getData());
    assertEquals("ACTIVE", response.getData().getStatus());
}
```

**Cucumber API Test:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Create and validate new policy
  Given I am authenticated as a "admin" user for API access
  When I create a new "Auto Insurance" policy for customer "John Smith" with premium "1200.00"
  Then the API response should be successful
  And the returned policy should have customer name "John Smith"
  And the returned policy should have premium amount "1200.00"
```
